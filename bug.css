The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected layout or rendering issues.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` within a flexbox item may not work as expected due to the order of operations.  Another common error involves missing spaces around the +,-,*,/ operators within the `calc()` function, e.g., `calc(100%-10px)` instead of `calc(100% - 10px)`.
